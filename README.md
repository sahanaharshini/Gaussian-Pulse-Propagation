# Gaussian-Pulse-Propagation
# Broadening of Gaussian Pulses

## Objective
Compare the results predicted by the linear system model of an optical fiber with the results of simulation.

---

## Theory
An optical fiber can be represented approximately by a linear system with an impulse response \(h(t)\) or a transfer function \(H(j\omega)\).  

If the optical source has a spectral width much greater than the signal bandwidth (e.g., the source is a directly modulated laser diode) and the operating wavelength is far from the zero-dispersion wavelength, then \(H(j\omega)\) is approximately Gaussian:

### Output Pulse Broadening
If a Gaussian pulse is input to a linear system with a Gaussian impulse response, the output is also Gaussian with RMS width:

## Layout
Place and connect the following components:
1. **User-defined bit sequence generator** – set to generate a single pulse of the specified width  
2. **Optical Gaussian pulse generator** – enter the chirp factor as a negative number  
3. **Optical fiber** – set according to specifications  
4. **Optical spectrum analyzers** and **optical time domain visualizers** at input and output of fiber  

---

## Simulation
- Set the parameters and run the simulation.  
- Use the visualizer displays to measure:  
  - FWHM width of input and output pulses  
  - FWHM width of optical spectra  

---

## Analysis
Compare the simulation results with the theoretical calculations and discuss any observed differences.
